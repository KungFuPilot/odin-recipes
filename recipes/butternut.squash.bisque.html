        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This butternut squash bisque is the perfect way to start fall. Even better than a PSL. There. I said it.</p> 
        <p>It's just a touch sweet from the ripe roasted butternut squash and apple. Plus, it has a little spicy kick from the jalapeno.</p>
        <p>The ingredients are simple, fresh, and healthy, but so flavorful and delicious.</p>

        <h2>Ingrediants</h2>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Prepare butternut squash: Cut rinsed squash in half length-wise.</p>
                    <p>Scoop out seeds, and place on a lined baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.</p>
                    <p>Bake in a 375°F for about 45 min until tender. Allow to cool.</p>
                    <p>coop out flesh and set aside for the recipe.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>In a large stockpot or Dutch oven, melt butter over medium-high heat.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add onion, celery, carrot, jalapeno, and garlic.</p>
                    <p>Saute, stirring frequently, until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add apple, squash, broth, and ground ginger. Stir to combine.</p>
                    <p>Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and let simmer for about 25 minutes,</p>
                    <p>until apples are tender. Remove from heat.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Blend soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Be careful of splatter!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Stir in cream, and season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
                    <p>Cook a few more minutes to increase the temperature, if necesary.</p>
                    <p>But do NOT bring to a boil (your cream will curdle!).</p>
                </li>
